To calculate the overall popularity rating of an artist on YouTube, a comprehensive formula can be created that combines key metrics into a single indicator. This would be a weighted sum of various factors, such as subscriber count, views, engagement, and more. Each factor can be multiplied by its respective weight to account for its influence on popularity.

### Example of a General Popularity Formula

`(R) = w1 * Subscribers + w2 * Views + w3 * Engagement + w4 * Mentions + w5 * Retention + w6 * Growth + w7 * Virality`

Where:

*   **w1 - w7** — weight coefficients for each metric.
    
*   **Subscribers** — number of subscribers on the artist’s channel.
    
*   **Views** — total number of views on the artist's channel or on specific videos.
    
*   **Engagement** — likes, comments, and shares relative to views.
    
*   **Mentions** — number of mentions in comments and reactions.
    
*   **Retention** — average video watch time.
    
*   **Growth** — growth in subscribers and views over time.
    
*   **Virality** — the presence of viral videos (e.g., videos with a significant spike in views in a short period).
    

### Defining Weights (w1 - w7) for Metrics:

Metrics should have different weights depending on which aspect of popularity is most important. For example:

*   **w1 (Subscribers)** — 0.25
    
*   **w2 (Views)** — 0.2
    
*   **w3 (Engagement)** — 0.2
    
*   **w4 (Mentions)** — 0.1
    
*   **w5 (Audience Retention)** — 0.1
    
*   **w6 (Subscriber/Views Growth)** — 0.1
    
*   **w7 (Viral Videos)** — 0.05
    

### Example Calculation:

Suppose the artist’s data looks like this:

*   **Subscribers**: 1,000,000
    
*   **Views**: 50,000,000
    
*   **Engagement**: 5% (calculated as (likes + comments + shares) / views \* 100)
    
*   **Mentions**: 10,000
    
*   **Audience Retention**: 60% (average watch time)
    
*   **Subscriber Growth**: +10% per month
    
*   **Viral Videos**: 1 viral video with 10,000,000 views in one week
    

Now, substituting these values into the formula:

L`0.25 * 1,000,000 + 0.2 * 50,000,000 + 0.2 * 5 + 0.1 * 10,000 + 0.1 * 60 + 0.1 * 10 + 0.05 * 1`

Now, let's calculate:

Plain `R = 250,000 + 10,000,000 + 1 + 1,000 + 6 + 1 + 0.05 ≈ 10,251,008`

This result gives an approximate popularity rating for the artist on YouTube. Of course, the weight coefficients can be adjusted depending on which parameters are most important in a specific situation.
